# VPC Creation

Auto mode vpcs

- will create a subnet in every region that google cloud supports
- As new regions are supported, new subnets get added to auto mode vpcs
- Can convert to custom mode but cannot convert back

Custom mode vpcs

- Start with no subnets
- give total control over how to structure network

### Default network

Unless you choose to disable it, each new project starts with a default network.
The default network is an auto mode VPC network with
[pre-populated IPv4 firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#more_rules_default_vpc).
The default network does not have pre-populated IPv6 firewall rules.

You can disable the creation of default networks by [creating an organization
policy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies) with the `[compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation`
constraint](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints).
Projects that inherit this policy won't have a default network.

IAM Section

Create specific role `BaseGCERole` which can be created based off other google managed roles.

- Drawback: should google at additional permissions to any of these roles, your custom role won't be updated
