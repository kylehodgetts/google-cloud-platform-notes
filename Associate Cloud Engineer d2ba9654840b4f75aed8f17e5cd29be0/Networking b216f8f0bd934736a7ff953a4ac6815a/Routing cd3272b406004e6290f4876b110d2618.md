# Routing

## To Google's Network

### Getting data to Google's Network

Premium (cold potato) vs Standard (hot potato) routing

Premium uses Google's backbone to minimize traffic exposure to the public internet

Can make smart routing decisions to keep transfer speeds high

Standard minimizes cost, resulting in lower network quality but still comparable to other public clouds. Uses public internet

## To the right Resource (Load Balancing)

- Latency reduction
    - Use servers physically close to clients
- Load balancing
    - Separate from auto-scaling
- System Design
    - Different servers may handle different parts of system
    - Especially when using microservices (instead of monolith)

Cross-Region Load balancing (with Global Anycast IPs)

- if using premium routing, google can decide where to send traffic

Cloud load balancer

- Internal and external; all types

HTTP(S) Load Balancer (with URL Map)

### Unicast vs Anycast

Unicast - One unique device in the world that can handle request, send it there

Anycast - Multiple devices that could handle this, send it to any one but ideally the closest

## Among Resources

### Getting data from one resource to another

- VPC (global) is Virtual Private Cloud - Your private SDN space in GCP
    - Not just resource-to-resource - Also manages the doors to outside and peers
- Subnets (regional) create logical spaces to contain resources
    - All subnets can reach all others â€” globally without any need for VPNs
        - Consider data transfer charges
- Routes (global) define next hop for traffic based on destination IP
    - Routes are global and apply by Instance-level tags, not by subnet.
    - No route to the internet gateway means no such data can flow
- Firewall Rules (global) further filter data flow that would otherwise route
    - All Firewall les are global and apply by instance-level tags or service accts.
    - Default Firewall Rules are restrictive inbound and permissive outbound

RFC1918 defines private (non-internet) address ranges you can use:

- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16
