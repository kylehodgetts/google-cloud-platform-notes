- Scaling is manual
- Data is automatically encrypted
    - Can use Google managed key or customer managed key
- Easy import export using cloud storage
- Pay for underlying GCE instances and PDs

## BigQuery

[BigQuery: Cloud Data Warehouse | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)

- Multi-Regional
- Serverless column-store data warehouse for analytics using SQL
- Scales internally so it can scan TB in seconds and PB in minutes
- Pay for GB actually scanned during queries
    - Attempts to reuse cached results, which are free
- Pay for data-stored GB-months
    - Cheaper when table not modified for 90 days (reading still fine)
- Pay for GBs added via streaming inserts

## BigTable

- Zonal
- Low latency & high throughput NoSQL Db for large operational & analytical apps
- Supports open-source HBase API
- Integrates with Hadoop, Dataflow, Dataproc
- Scales seamlessly and unlimitedly
    - Storage autoscales
    - Processing nodes must be scaled manually
- Pay for processing node hours
- Pay for GB-hours used for storage (cheap HDD or fast SSD)

## Datastore

[Datastore | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/)

[Datastore Queries | Cloud Datastore Documentation | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/queries)

- Regional, Multi-Regional
- Managed & autoscaled NoSQL DB with indexes, queries and ACID trans support
- NoSQL, so queries can get complicated

- Automatic "built-in" indexes for simple filtering and sorted (ASC, DESC)
- Manual composite indexes for more complicated, but beware of exploding
- Pay for GB-Months of storage used (inc. indexes)
- Pay for IO operations (deletes, reads, writes) performed (i.e. no pre-provisioning)

## Firebase DBs

[Choose a Database: Cloud Firestore or Realtime Database | Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rtdb-vs-firestore)

- **Firebase Realtime DB** - zonal
- **Cloud Firestore** - Multi-Regional
- NoSQL document stores with ~real-time client updates via managed websockets
- **Firebase DB** is single (potentially huge) JSON doc, located only in central US
- **Cloud Firestore** has collections, documents and contained data
- Free tier (Spark), flat tier (Flame) or usage-based pricing (Blaze)
    - **Realtime DB**: Pay more for GB per month stored and GB downloaded
    - **Firestore**: Pay for operations and much less for storage and transfer
