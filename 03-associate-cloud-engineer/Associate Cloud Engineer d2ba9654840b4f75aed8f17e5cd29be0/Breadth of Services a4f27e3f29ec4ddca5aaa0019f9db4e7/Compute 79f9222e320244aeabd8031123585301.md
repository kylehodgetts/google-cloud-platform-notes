- Zonal
- IaaS
- Can custom CPU and RAM specs (not conform to predefined instance type)
- Pay by the second, 1 minute min
- Auto cheaper if you keep running - sustained use discount
- Even cheaper for preemptible or use long term usage
- Can add GPUs and Paid OSes for extra cost
- Live migration - Google can live migrate instances to new hosts as needed
